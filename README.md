# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh


<!-- for this task readme file -->

Tech STack => React,Tail-wind

i have used the vite for create the project and after if home page i have done the design that not as per figma look almost similar to
figma  and use react-big-calender we click on the any event or simply title ,time  that simply use the weekly calender view and crated sample todays event for the check and create the schedular and here create simple design not exactly as figma and if we do /chart in 
url then api call and I have used sunburst chart at start i have displayed data but it look weird because of so many category,sub-category and its values so I saw the that things on hover basically we can say tooltip .
